# SmoothTypeForFirefox

When I went to find a Microsoft Word style equivalkent for Firefox, I became very disappointed in the lack of options. I found an exxtension on Chrome and edited the files in order for it to function on FireFox.
To use it:

## Installation steps
If you want to install this extension unpacked:
1. download the code as a .ZIP and extract
2. Type about:debugging in your Firefox search bar
3. Click on the "This Firefox" tab.
4. Click on Choose Load Temporary Add-on
5. Open the unzipped folder in your file manager and choose manifest.json
6. Go into Google Docs and see everything work as expected!
