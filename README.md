# SmoothTypeForFirefox

When I went to find a Microsoft Word style equivalent for Firefox, I became very disappointed in the lack of options. I found an extension on Chrome and edited the files in order for it to function on FireFox.

## ALL CREDIT GOES TO https://github.com/jsz-05/jsz-SmoothType 
## They made this amazing Chrome Extension!!!

## To use it:
1. Download the code as a .ZIP and extract
2. Type about:debugging in your Firefox search bar
3. Click on the "This Firefox" tab.
4. Click on Choose Load Temporary Add-on
5. Open the unzipped folder in your file manager and choose manifest.json
6. Go into Google Docs and see everything work as expected!

It currently supports Google Docs and the Cells in Google Sheets, the text in Google sheets is what is currently being added
